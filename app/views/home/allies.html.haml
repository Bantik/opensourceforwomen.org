      %h1 How to Be an Ally

      %p
        Thank you for your interest in Open Source for Women! As this site is intended to be a women-only space, we're only accepting applications for membership only for those individuals who identify as women. But don't despair! We need allies to make this site-- and the open source world in general-- more welcoming and inclusive.

      %p
        To that end, we have assembled a list of resources that may be helpful to you as an ally.
